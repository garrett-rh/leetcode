# Leetcode Solutions

This repo is filled with my solutions for leetcode. As of right now, its all golang so you can run all of the solutions with 
```
go test ./...
```
OR
```
sh run-tests.sh
```

***run-tests.sh*** takes an optional positional argument where you can specify a directory to test but must be run with bash or another similar shell. For example, ```bash run-tests.sh ./easy/two_sum``` will run the easy/two_sum/two_sum_test.go from the repo's base folder.
